## Description
This application is for users to be able to create a "bucket list" of goals they would like to accomplish, such as things to do and places to see. After a user signs in or signs up, they are taken to a dashboard where they can see all of the list items they have created, with an option to create a new item or delete any of them. When a user goes to view their list, the top 8 items appear, creating a neat, compact list of attainable goals.
